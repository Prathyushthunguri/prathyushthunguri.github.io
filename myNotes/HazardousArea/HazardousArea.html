        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Hazardous area classification is usually done in facilities and environments where there is a likelihood of explosive gas mixture either for a limited time or for an extended period of time. This is done to reduce the risk of explosion or fire to ensure the process area or plant is safe for work</li>
            <li>Hazardous area classification is, therefore, the division of areas around equipment handling flammable fluids or process plants for explosive gases and fluids into hazardous and non-hazardous areas and the sub-division of hazardous areas into zones.</li>
        </ul>

                            <li>These releases are usually more than 10h/year but less than 1000 h/year.</li>
                            <li>An example is the releases from the seals of pumps and compressors, releases from relief valve leakages discharging into the atmosphere, manual sampling outlets, venting and draining points, automatic instrument gas vents., and vents from a sump.</li>

        <h2>Purpose of Hazardous Area Classification</h2>
        <p>The main purpose of hazardous area classification is to identify areas around equipment handling flammable fluids into hazardous and non-hazardous areas and the sub-division of hazardous areas into zones.</p>
        <p>In order to avoid the risk of fire and explosion, hazardous area classification was adopted to ensure the following.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>That the right electrical equipment designed and suitable for the location is selected.</li>
            <li>The identification of a location of equipment or process plant there could be a source of ignition or its selection of the right equipment whose operation will not become the source of ignition for an explosive atmosphere.</li>
            <li>Determining the maximum allowable surface temperature for particular areas and clearly marking out locations for escape routes.</li>
            <li>Identify and determine the appropriate location for flammable gas detectors in process plants.</li>
            <li>Appropriate location of air inlet and outlet for ventilation systems or combustion equipment.</li>
            <li>Identify, plan, and control all forms of hot work to be carried out within the facility and in the process plant area.</li>
            <li>Identify the right location to position lifesaving appliances, radioactive stores, and emergency control points in non-hazardous areas of the process plant.</li>
        </ul>

                    <td>Zone 0</td>
                    <td>Zone 0 is an area where there is the presence of an explosive gas mixture or atmosphere continuously or for an extended period of time. In this zone, the explosive atmosphere is usually present for more than 1000 hours per year (1000h/yr).</td>
                    <td>
                        <p>As a general practice, you can hardly find electrical equipment installed in Zone 0</p>

                            <li>Inside of AGO or PMS tanks Farms. In tank farms, the quantity of oil and gas products stored creates a large presence of a combustible atmosphere.</li>
                            <li>Areas where there is the presence of combustible gas.</li>
                            <li>Inside storage tanks: Tanks used for storing volatile substances like gasoline or crude oil can create explosive environments, particularly if there is inadequate ventilation or other safety measures.</li>
                            <li>Fuel storage areas: Areas, where fuel is stored for generators or other equipment, can also be considered Zone 0 if the atmosphere is continuously or frequently explosive.  </li>

                    <td>Zone 1 is an area where there are explosive gas mixtures or atmosphere is likely to occur in normal operation. The explosive gas mixture or atmosphere in this zone will last for more than 10h/year but will be less than 1000h/yr. This means that in a normal operation, the explosive atmosphere will exist but will not last continuously; it will be limited.</td>
                    <td>
                        <p> Some examples of Zone 1 areas are listed below.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Wellhead platform: The wellhead platform is a common example of a zone 1 area in an oil and gas facility. This area is highly volatile and constitutes a significant risk of fire or explosion. Thus, it requires special design considerations to ensure the safety of personnel working in the area.</li>
                            <li>Refinery processing units: The refinery processing units are another common zone 1 area in oil and gas facilities. These units involve the use of high-pressure equipment, intense heat, and volatile chemicals, making it a hazardous area. Thus, careful consideration of equipment and design is necessary to ensure the safety of the personnel working in these areas.</li>
                            <li>Loading and unloading stations: Loading and unloading stations are also significant zone 1 areas in oil and gas facilities. These areas involve the handling and transfer of highly volatile fluids that can cause fires or explosions. Thus, special safety considerations are necessary to regulate these areas and ensure they comply With safety standards.</li>
                            <li>Gas processing facilities: Gas processing facilities are also common examples of zone 1 areas in oil and gas facilities. These facilities involve the processing of various gases that can be highly combustible. Thus, the facility requires careful analysis of design and equipment to ensure the safety of the personnel working in the area.</li>
                            <li>Tank farms: Tank farms, which are used for storing oil or gas, are also considered zone 1 areas in oil and gas facilities. These areas are highly susceptible to fires, explosions, and leakage of hazardous materials, making them a considerable safety concern. Thus, special precautions related to equipment and design are necessary to ensure the safety of personnel in these facility areas.</li>

                        <p>Below are some examples of areas that fall into Zone 2 with short time periods of explosive atmosphere present in a year's time.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pump houses: Pump houses are used to transport liquids and gases in pipelines. The presence of flammable liquids and gases makes this area a Zone 2 classification.</li>
                            <li>Chemical storage and processing areas: Chemicals used in the oil and gas industry can be highly volatile and flammable. Chemical storage and processing areas are classified as Zone 2 to protect workers from exposure to hazardous materials and explosive atmospheres.</li>
